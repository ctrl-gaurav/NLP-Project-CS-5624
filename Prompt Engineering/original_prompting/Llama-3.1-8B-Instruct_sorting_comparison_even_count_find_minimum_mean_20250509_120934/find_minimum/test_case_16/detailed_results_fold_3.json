However, since Python is an efficient language for such tasks, we can use the built-in min() function to find the minimum number.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules (none required in this case).\n2. Define the list of numbers.\n3. Use the min() function to find the minimum number in the list.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of numbers\nnumbers = [672, 880, -58, -284, -375, 680, 628, 784, -534, -544, -952, 351, -605, -184, -328, -430]\n\n# Use the min() function to find the minimum number in the list\nminimum = min(numbers)\n\n# Print the minimum number\nprint(\"The minimum number is:\", minimum)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the minimum number from the given list.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a simple for loop to find the minimum number:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of numbers\nnumbers = [672, 880, -58, -284, -375, 680, 628, 784, -534, -544, -952, 351, -605, -184, -328, -430]\n\n# Initialize the minimum number as the first number in the list\nminimum = numbers[0]\n\n# Iterate over the list to find the minimum number\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num < minimum:\n        minimum = num\n\n# Print the minimum number\nprint(\"The minimum number is:\", minimum)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will give you the minimum number from the list.
