Since -419 is less than 55, we move on to the next number, 359. -419 is less than 359, so we move on to the next number, 296. -419 is less than 296, so we move on to the next number, 268. -419 is less than 268, so we move on to the next number, -314. -419 is greater than -314, so we move on to the next number, -809. -419 is greater than -809, so we move on to the next number, 676. -419 is less than 676.\n\nSo, the minimum number in the list is -419.\n\n\\boxed{-419}",
