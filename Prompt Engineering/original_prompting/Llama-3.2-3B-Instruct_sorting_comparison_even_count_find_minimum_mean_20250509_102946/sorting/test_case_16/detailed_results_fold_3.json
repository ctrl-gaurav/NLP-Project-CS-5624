First, we'll start with the smallest number, which is -998.\n2. Then, we'll add the next smallest number, which is -154.\n3. Next, we'll add -95, which is smaller than -154.\n4. Then, we'll add -260, which is smaller than -154 and -95.\n5. Next, we'll add -54, which is smaller than -260.\n6. Then, we'll add -89, which is smaller than -54.\n7. Next, we'll add -616, which is smaller than -89.\n8. Then, we'll add -699, no -689 is the 8th number, then -616, then -699 is not there so -689 is 7th so we add -780, then -889.\n9. Next, we'll add 20, which is smaller than -689.\n10. Then, we'll add 61, which is smaller than 20.\n11. Next, we'll add 111, which is smaller than 61.\n12. Then, 275, which is smaller than 111.\n13. Next, 346, which is smaller than 275.\n14. Then, 549, which is smaller than 346.\n15. Finally, 689, which is the last number.\n\nThe sorted list is: \n-998, -889, -780, -616, -260, -154, -95, -54, -89, 20, 61, 111, 275, 346, 549, 689\n\nSo the sorted list is: \n\\boxed{[-998, -889, -780, -616, -260, -154, -95, -54, -89, 20, 61, 111, 275, 346, 549, 689]}",
