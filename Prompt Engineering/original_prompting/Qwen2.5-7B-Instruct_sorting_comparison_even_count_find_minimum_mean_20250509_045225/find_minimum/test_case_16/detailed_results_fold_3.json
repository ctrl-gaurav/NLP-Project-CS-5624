However, a more efficient method is to use a loop to iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest number found so far.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number. We can start with the first number in the list as the initial minimum.\n2. Iterate through the list, comparing each number to the current minimum.\n3. If a number is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum.\n4. After completing the iteration, the variable holding the minimum number will contain the smallest number in the list.\n\nLet's apply this method to the given list:\n\nList = [-687, 285, -673, 622, 393, -136, 221, -870, -212, -219, 220, -42, 83, -486, 988, 133]\n\n1. Initialize the minimum with the first number: \\(-687\\).\n2. Iterate through the list:\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(285\\): \\(-687\\) is smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(-673\\): \\(-687\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(622\\): \\(-687\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(393\\): \\(-687\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(-136\\): \\(-687\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(221\\): \\(-687\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-687\\) with \\(-870\\): \\(-870\\) is smaller, update the minimum to \\(-870\\).\n   - Compare \\(-870\\) with \\(-212\\): \\(-870\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-870\\) with \\(-219\\): \\(-870\\) is still smaller.\n   - Compare \\(-870\\) with \\(2",
